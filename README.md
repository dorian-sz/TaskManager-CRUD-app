# Task manager app (Under development)
### Welcome to the Task Manager CRUD App repository
The main feature of this app is the ability to create and delete tasks which are then stored in the database for the specific user. New users can be created in the register page or you can log into an existing user on the login page.

## Features and Technologies
This is an ongoing project where I practice and learn new technologies and techniques. It features:
- ASP.NET Core Web API backend
- Entity Framework which is an ORM framework for handling database entities
- MSSQL database server
- React was used for the frontend which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- JWT authentication and authorization
- Protected React routes
